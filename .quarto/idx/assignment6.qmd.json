We are here to support you!\n\n\nSubmit your assignment via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/833089).\n\n- The Gradescope should be live at least a few days before the HW deadline. Feel free to remind us on Ed if the Gradescope isn't live in time! \n\n-   Make sure to tag your answers properly on Gradescope, or else you may be docked points for making the grading process more time-consuming.\n    \n**You must submit a PDF of any PingPong chats that include code you used in your submission.**\n    \n-   This should take the form of one long PDF.\n    One way to do this is to copy all of your relevant PingPong chats into a Google Doc, and then print the doc as a PDF.\n\n-   You are responsible for understanding all the code you submit, regardless of whether or not you used PingPong for help.\n\n**For multiple choice problems, submit your answers and justifications as a PDF.**\n\n- You are free to use any text-editing software to write your answers.\n\n**For the project component, you will produce both (1) a .Rmd file with your code and (2) an PDF file containing the code and output.**\n\n-  **Make sure to clearly indicate your group members at the top of your submission.** You should each submit the same version of your project component.\n\n-   On Gradescope, you will submit a single ZIP file containing both the .Rmd and PDF files.\n\n-   To generate a PDF of your code and output, do not knit to PDF.\n    Instead, knit your .Rmd file as HTML, open the HTML file in a web browser, and then **print the HTML as a PDF, making sure that none of your code or output is cut off.** You can generate an HTML file in RStudio by pressing `Knit` and then `Knit to HTML`.\n\n-   The knitting process will not work if there are errors in your code, so be sure to leave plenty of time to knit your lab notebooks before the deadline.\n\n-   Proofread your PDF to make sure all of your answers and plots are visible.\n    If your PDF file is really long, it is possible that your code is printing out a large dataset or a really long vector.\n    Make sure to comment out any code that prints more information than each question asks you for.\n    \n## üìù Forms to complete\n\n1. Complete a [5-minute research survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfL9PRcRhKMPTPGrdH1jEIrNNJ768jI6NnhE6IixJJy6taDAg/viewform?usp=sf_link) on PingPong!\n\n    - You are one of the first classes **in the history of human civilization** to\n    have access to a course-customized large-language model. Your responses to this\n    survey are **very** valuable to the scientific community.\n    \n    - If you don't like PingPong, or you've rarely used it, we still want to hear from you! \n    \n    - As a thank you for completing the survey, I will share a summary and analysis of the responses once the survey is closed.\n\n2. Take 5 minutes to complete the [STAT 131A course evaluation](https://course-evaluations.berkeley.edu/).\n\n    - Van and Josh would be **really** grateful to hear your feedback about the course. \n    \n    - We want to make 131A as effective as possible for as many students as possible, and we want to make sure your voice is heard!\n    \n## üíØ Getting started on final exam prep (25% of the HW6 grade)\n\nAnswer the following multiple choice questions.\n\n- For each question, **provide a complete justification of your answer**. In other\nwords, you should state why option A is correct/incorrect, and why option B\nis correct/incorrect.\n\n<br/>\n\n**1. Linear regression is considered a parametric method because:**\n\nA. Linear combinations can take on any value between $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$.\n\nB. The residuals in the assumed data-generating process for linear regression are normally distributed.\n\nC. Both A and B are correct.\n\nD. Neither A nor B is correct.\n\n<br/>\n\n**2. Logistic regression is considered a classification algorithm because:**\n\nA. Outcomes in the training data are binary.\n\nB. Log odds are modeled as a linear combination of coefficients and covariates.\n\nC. Both A and B are correct.\n\nD. Neither A nor B is correct.\n\n<br/>\n    \n**3. Principal component analysis (PCA) is considered an unsupervised method because:**\n\nA. It changes the frame of reference of the data to maximimize variance\nacross each orthogonal dimension.\n\nB. It predicts outcomes conditional on the inputted covariates.\n\nC. Both A and B are correct.\n\nD. Neither A nor B is correct.\n\n<br/>\n    \n**4. LOESS is considered a supervised method because:**\n\nA. Unlike linear regression, it can model non-linear relationships.\n\nB. Unlike logistic regression, it requires the outcome variable to be\nreal-valued and not binary.\n\nC. Both A and B are correct.\n\nD. Neither A nor B is correct.\n\n<br/>\n\n**5. Bootstrap resampling of the observed data is considered a non-parametric approach because:**\n\nA. It can be used to estimate the standard error of the sampling distribution of a sample statistic.\n\nB. It requires us to assume how the input data was generated.\n\nC. Both A and B are correct.\n\nD. Neither A nor B is correct.\n\n<br/>\n\n**6. The permutation test is considered a non-parametric approach because:**\n\nA. It cannot be implemented in a reasonable amount of time without using a computer.\n\nB. It assumes that the sampling distribution of the permutation test statistic is approximately normal.\n\nC. Both A and B are correct.\n\nD. Neither A nor B is correct.\n\n<br/>\n\n**7. The $k$-means clustering algorithm is considered an unsupervised method because:**\n    \nA. We can compare the identified centroids to a set of true centroids. \n\nB. It identifies the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset, without assuming how many points should be assigned to each cluster.\n\nC. Both A and B are correct.\n\nD. Neither A nor B is correct.\n\n<br/>\n\n## üèóÔ∏è Getting started on the course project (75% of the HW6 grade)\n\nPlease read the [course project page](project.html).\n\n1.
