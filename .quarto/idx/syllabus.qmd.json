See below for more details.\n\n### Labs üß™\n\nLab 101: Tuesday and Thursday, 11am-12pm \\@ [Evans 330](https://www.berkeley.edu/map/evans-hall/)\n\nLab 102: Tuesday and Thursday, 4-5pm \\@ Hearst Mining Bldg 310 (Hearst is next to [Evans Hall](https://www.berkeley.edu/map/evans-hall/))\n\nYou should only be signed up for one lab group.\n\nLab attendance is optional, but highly encouraged.\n\n### Office hours (OH) üóìÔ∏è\n\n<!-- OH times and locations are tentative.  -->\n\n<!-- - Note: There are no office hours in the first week of the course! -->\n\nJosh's Office Hours:\n\n- MWF 1:45pm + 3pm in lobby outside Morgan 101 (before and after lecture)\n- T+Th 7-8:30pm @ Evans 334\n\nVan's Office Hours:\n\n- ~~Wednesdays 10am-12pm @ Evans 434~~\n- Wednesdays 4-5pm (group tutoring), TBD\n- Wednesdays 5-6pm (office hours), TBD\n- Fridays 9am-11am on Zoom\n- For security reasons, Zoom links for OH are posted on [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1537932).\n\n20-minute coffee chats with Josh on the phone (experimental!):\n\n- One slot every weekday at 11am.\n- Designed for career and life advising, not logistical concerns or help with coursework.\n- Please limit to no more than one chat per month. \n- Book [at this link](https://calendly.com/jdgg-berkeley/20-minute-phone-call-with-josh?)\n\n<!-- - OH times will be posted shortly after the semester begins. -->\n<!-- - Please note that there are no regular OH during the first week of class. -->\nWe may add or reschedule OH if needed. \n\n- Please [create a private Ed post](https://edstem.org/us/courses/63606/discussion/) if you have conflicts with all of the scheduled OH. \n\n**Coming to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help.** In fact, the students who come to OH are often the most successful in the course.\n\n- OH is a great opportunity to discuss not only topics directly related to the course, but also anything else that's on your mind.\n- We also welcome questions about career trajectories and research opportunities at UC Berkeley and beyond.\n- Keep in mind that you **do not** need to come to office hours with an agenda. Listening in is welcomed and encouraged!\n- Finally, attending and participating in office hours is a great way to set yourself up for a terrific letter of recommendation. This is true for most courses!\n- If you don't already, I highly recommend that you attend the instructors' office hours in other classes from time to time.\n\n## Study groups üë•\n\nWe encourage you to work together in groups to solidify your understanding of the course material. \n\nIf you would like assistance forming a study group, please complete [the study group form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2XYenKGH8jtXAOUxSl8oXpQxiLwwDGw0edC9Qw56iwDPDjA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by Monday, September 2nd at 11:59pm PT. \n\nOur goal is to form the study groups ASAP, \nso students can begin discussing the first homework assignment.\n\n## Concurrent enrollment and auditing üëÇ\n\nConcurrent enrollment students wishing to register for the class should fill out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbYciXBFrZvO1WbtsIOTCOiWmV2EvC3RqN0dW9_3NHzE2QWQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to give me information about their previous coursework so we can assess whether they have satisfied the pre-requisites.\n\n**UPDATE**: Stat 131A will not be enrolling concurrent enrollment students in Fall 2024. But, concurrent enrollment students are welcome to audit the course.\n\nStudents who wish to audit the course can also fill out the top portion of this form to get their email added to [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1537932) as a guest. \nOnly name and email is needed for auditors.\n\n## Course platforms üñ•Ô∏è\n\n[bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1537932) will only be used for secure course material, like exam solutions, grades, and office hour Zoom links.\n\nAll other course materials will be posted on [the public course homepage](https://stat131a.berkeley.edu/fall-2024).\n\nAssignments should be submitted via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/833089).\n\nAll course communication will take place via [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/63606/discussion/).\n\nThe only acceptable large-language model (LLM) for use in Stat 131a is [PingPong](https://pingpong.hks.harvard.edu/login). \n\n- **Unless otherwise indicated, all other LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) are prohibited and considered cheating in this course.**\n- Enrolled students will receive an invitation to PingPong via email shortly after the semester begins. \n\n## Grades üíØ\n\nGrades are calculated as follows:\n\n-   Lecture attendance and participation: 10%\n-   Labs: 10%\n-   Homework: 20%\n-   Final project: 15%\n-   Midterm 1 (during class): 10%\n-   Midterm 2 (during class): 15%\n-   Final: 20%\n\nGrades will not be curved.\n\n- In other words, there is no limit to the proportion of students with an A, B, etc. You are incentivized to help each other learn and succeed.\n- You are guaranteed an A if you score 93% or higher, an A- if 90% or higher, a B+ if 87% or higher, a B if 83% or higher, and so on.\n- A+ grades are awarded rarely, and only for truly exceptional performance.\n- Grade cutoffs may be adjusted downward at the end of the semester, but this is not guaranteed.\n\nSee attendance policy below for an opportunity to earn up to two percentage points of extra credit. \n\n## Lecture technology policy ‚ùå üë©‚Äçüíª $~$ ‚úÖüì±\n\nMost lectures will consist of an interactive problem-solving session, followed by a hands-on demo or coding session.\n\n- **Laptops and tablets with attached keyboards are not allowed during the problem-solving session**, though you are permitted to use a tablet to take handwritten notes. \n\n- If you need to use technology for accessibility reasons, the previous bullet does not apply to you. \n\n- Laptop use is permitted (and encouraged!) during the hands-on demo and coding sessions. \n\n- Phones are allowed during lecture. It is preferable to use a phone to submit conceptual questions and neighbor discussion answers during lecture.\n\n- [This article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html) explains why we have the laptop policy. Long story short, laptop use can negatively impact the learning of nearby students (i.e., this policy does not punish you; the policy prevents you from punishing others).\n\n- The course staff reserves the right to reduce your lecture attendance grade for violating the technology policy.\n\n## Lecture recordings üé•\n\nLectures will be recorded automatically.\n\n- The course staff cannot guarantee audio or video quality.\n- Lecture recordings are posted on [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1537932).\n\nLabs and office hours are not recorded. \n\nThe homework assignments may occasionally ask you to watch additional recordings to supplement the lecture material (e.g., if we run out of time covering an essential topic).\n\n## Attendance and participation ‚úã\n\nIn-person lecture attendance is mandatory. \n\n- It is **critically** important to practice learning in a live setting.  \n- Difficulty with paying attention in live meetings is a common hurdle for new grads.\n\nLecture attendance is a substantial component of your grade. \n\n- Lecture cannot be attended remotely. \n- You are allowed three unexcused lecture absences. Each additional absence will impact your lecture attendance grade. \n\n**If you cannot attend a lecture due to an extenuating circumstance, please [complete the lecture attendance excusal form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQLdZRc0fCGDp-4zwtwvcbbh5F2olKB7dx_qVrNKmsY43cxg/viewform?usp=sf_link) before the lecture starts.**\n\n- This form can be completed months, weeks, or days in advance of lecture.\n\nAcceptable extenuating circumstances include: \n\n- Illness. **DO NOT come to class if you are sick!** Even a sniffle! \n- Personal emergencies. \n- Important life events (e.g., weddings)\n- Pre-planned collegiate athletic events in which you are a participant.\n- This list is not exhaustive. If you think an absence should be excused, [complete this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQLdZRc0fCGDp-4zwtwvcbbh5F2olKB7dx_qVrNKmsY43cxg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and explain your reasoning. We cannot guarantee that your absence will be excused, but we will be reasonable. \n\n### Concept checks ‚úÖ\n\nWe will use in-class concept checks and neighbor discussions to track attendance. \n\n- Concept checks are not graded.\n- Concept checks are answered via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnthLeOwlfNrkCJ69LWgWnmaA-qTNcbtxrHgMmWD4LCZVNug/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n<!-- - However, when deciding borderline final grades, we may consider demonstrated effort on concept checks. -->\n- Submitting a concept check outside of standard lecture time is considered cheating and an honor code violation. We will use your seat number and submission time to validate that your responses were entered during lecture time. We reserve the right to photograph the lecture hall to verify attendance. \n\n### Neighbor discussions üó£Ô∏è\n\nIn addition to concept checks, there may be one or more neighbor discussions during each lecture.\n\n- Neighbor discussion answers are submitted via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8XcctXgOv9kyJEdEL0JZtUMnhc5KWVEh1ifDL4qO6xB93Vg/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n- Neighbor discussion answers are not graded.\n\nTo encourage discussion among all classmates, **we will award up to two percentage points of extra credit for having a variety of neighbors.**\n\n- The students with the highest number of unique neighbors will receive the full two percentage points of extra credit.\n- Everyone else will receive, at the minimum, a fraction of extra credit proportional to their number of unique neighbors.\n- For example, if you sit next to the same person all semester, you can receive full participation credit for neighbor discussions, but you will very little extra credit.\n- The extra credit policy will only take effect if at least one student has spoken to at least 20 unique neighbors over the course of the semester.\n- As above, submitting a neighbor discussion answer outside of standard lecture time is considered cheating and an honor code violation.\n\n## Homework üìù\n\nThere are 6 homework assignments planned, though the exact number may change.\n\n- Homework will be a combination of computational exercises and data analysis using the computer, as well as conceptual questions.\n- Homework assignments are weighted equally. \n\nHW is generally due every other week.\n\n- Homework assignments will be posted to the course website at least one week before the HW deadline.\n- All homework assignments will be submitted via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/833089) and are due by 11:59 pm of the due date.\n\nWe will not drop your lowest-scoring homework assignment.\n\n- Instead, we will raise your lowest homework score to 80\\% of its maximum score, regardless of what you actually scored.\n- We will not change the grade of your lowest-scoring homework assignment if its score is above 80\\%.\n\n**Poorly organized assignments will be docked points at the discretion of the grader.**\n\n- It is critical to have empathy for the person who will be reviewing your work, whether a member of the course staff, another student providing feedback, or your future manager. \n\n## Late HW ‚è∞\n\n**You are allotted five slip days for labs and homework assignments.** \n\n- Each slip day adds 24 hours to the deadline. \n- Slip days cannot be used on the final project or exams.\n- Slip days are intended to account for unexpected delays, like minor illness or homework overload. \n- There is no extra credit awarded for unused slip days. \n- You cannot use partial slip days. \n\n**You are allowed to use, at most, two slip days per assignment.**\n\n- In other words, assignments will not be accepted more than 48 hours after the original due date. \n- This policy ensures that we can grade all assignments in a timely fashion. \n\nIf you plan to use slip days, **do not contact the course staff.**\n\n- We will automatically account for slip days when calculating grades.\n\nExtensions will only be granted if required by a Letter of Accommodation (LoA), or in extraordinary circumstances (e.g., medical emergencies). \n\n## Labs üß™\n\nDuring lab sessions, a GSI will review conceptual material and help you work through lab coding assignments.\n\n- Lab sections meet twice a week.\n- There are no lab sections the first week of classes.\n\nWe plan to have 12 lab assignments.\n\n- Each assignment will teach you how to perform the analyses shown in class using `R`.\n- Labs are intended to be finished or mostly finished during section.\n- HW assignments may build on the exercises covered in lab.\n\nLab assignments are generally due on Mondays at 11:59 pm and should be submitted via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/833089).\n\n- Labs are graded on completion, not correctness.\n\nWhile there is no Week 1 lab, there is a self-paced [Lab 0](assets/Lab00.html) for you to work through independently. This lab is not graded.\n\n- **Before the first lab section on Tuesday of Week 2, work through [Lab 0](assets/Lab00.html).**\n\n- You do not have to turn in this lab, but we will assume that you have worked through this lab and understand the code.\n- If you have questions about this lab, please come to office hours or post on Ed.\n\n<!-- ### Communicating with Instructional Staff -->\n\n<!-- The best way to ask a question to the instructor or GSI is to send a private message through Ed Discussion. -->\n<!-- This way it does not get lost in our inboxes and we can both see it and keep track of the responses to it. -->\n<!-- Ed Discussion will be checked by one of us at least once a day during the weekday, and almost *never* in the evening or the weekend. -->\n<!-- You can mark these messages with \"Administrative\" to make sure we see them. -->\n\n<!-- If you absolutely must email, in order for your email to make it into our inbox, the subject of your email must contain the text ‚ÄúSTAT 131A‚Äù. -->\n<!-- None of the instructors explain course material over email and will not respond to emails with such requests. -->\n<!-- Please come to office hours or discussion sections for questions about the material, or post questions to Ed Discussion. -->\n\n## Final project üìä\n\nThe final project will be due on the last day of reading week, **Friday December 13**.\n\nMore details on the final project will be provided later in the semester.\n\n## Exams ‚åõ\n\nThe first midterm is scheduled for **Wednesday October 9** and will take place during lecture in Morgan 101. \n\nThe second midterm is scheduled for **Wednesday November 13** and will take place during lecture in Morgan 101.\n\nThe final exam will take place **Thursday December 19, 3-6pm** (scheduled by the registrar). Location TBD.\n\n- All exams are cumulative, with emphasis on more recent material.\n\n- To acknowledge maturation over the course of the semester, exams are increasingly weighted in your course grade.\n\n- If you do not perform well on the first midterm, you can still do very well in 131a!\n\n- **Update:** We will raise your midterm 1 and midterm 2 scores to up to 80% of the maximum score, based on your performance on the relevant sections of the final.\n\n**If you cannot attend an exam due to an extenuating circumstance, please contact the course staff ASAP to determine whether your circumstance qualifies for a make-up exam.**\n\n<!-- # Using R and resources for R -->\n\n<!-- We will be using R to analyze data in this class. -->\n<!-- See [R resources](../../RSupport/RResources.html) for more information. -->\n<!-- You will be going through an introductory lab ([Lab 0](/RSupport/Lab00.html)) to help you refresh your skills. -->\n<!-- See our page on [R resources](../../RSupport/RResources.html) for useful tutorials and online help. -->\n\n<!-- We expect that students have already been exposed to R or python in either Stat 20 or Data 8, respectively. -->\n<!-- For those who come from Data 8, the first labs will help you transfer that knowledge over to R. -->\n<!-- Both languages are excellent platforms for analyzing data, are widely used in data science, and have their individual strengths. -->\n<!-- R has been developed within the statistics community specifically for data analysis, while python is a general-purpose programming language which also has large data analysis capabilities. -->\n\n<!-- The lectures will be focused on the statistical concepts. -->\n<!-- Learning how to do these tasks in R will be the focus of the labs. -->\n<!-- Do not be surprised or worried about not following the details of R code during lectures -- that is not the point (furthermore, there will sometimes be code that is really specific to the instructional purposes of the lecture, e.g. to make a specific plot, and is beyond the scope of what you would be expected to understand how to do yourself). -->\n\n<!-- In addition to what you learn in lab, the class website provides for every book chapter, complementary html/.Rmd with the code used in the lecture that will contain brief explanations, available (here)\\[https://epurdom.github.io/Stat131A/RSupport/index.html\\]. -->\n\n<!-- Furthermore, we expect that you've already been introduced to the basics, so that we will not need to walk you through every detail. -->\n<!-- The first step if you are confused about code is to look at the documentation of the function in R; the second step is to do a quick google search; and of course, ask us questions if you can't figure it out after doing that. -->\n\n## Textbooks and resources üìñ\n\nEverything you need to know for Stat 131a will be covered in lectures, labs, and assignments.\n\n- It is possible to do very well in Stat 131a without ever referring to an outside textbook or resource.\n\nHowever, most of the course material is covered by the online textbook developed specifically for 131A.\n\n- You can find the textbook [here](https://epurdom.github.io/Stat131A/book/).\n\nThe [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) is an *excellent* resource.\n\n- StatQuest provides videos on many of the topics we will cover in class. The instructor is very entertaining!\n\nIf you would like some additional optional reading, you can try the following books.\n\n-   [Theory Meets Data](http://stat88.org/textbook/content/intro.html) by Ani Adhikari. This is the online book for STAT 88 that covers introductory probability at the level of Stat 20.\n- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This is a free online book that covers the `tidyverse` set of `R` packages.\n-   *The Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis* by Ramsey and Schafer\n-   *Introductory Statistics with R* by Peter Dalgaard\n\nNone of these books covers all of the topics we will cover in 131A, nor do they necessarily have the same perspective and focus as this class.\n<!-- -- they do not have extensive use of bootstrapping and resampling methods. -->\nBut for those students wanting some additional structure or R assistance, these books may be helpful and should be at the right level for this class.\n\nStat 20 and Data 8 are similar courses, but each covers some subjects that the other does not.\nWhile we will cover these topics in class, you may find the following useful background if you are seeing them for the first time (more to follow):\n\n-   [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science](https://www.inferentialthinking.com), by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero -- chapters 11-13.\n\nThis is the online book used by Data 8.\nThese chapters introduce hypothesis testing using only resampling ideas, ideas which are not necessarily covered in Stat 20.\n<!-- Their examples integrate python code, which may not be familiar, but what the code is doing will probably make sense and not make it too difficult to follow. -->\n\n## Policy on Large Language Models (LLMs) üí¨\n\nLLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) are becoming increasingly essential in the workplace. \n\n- To that end, the use of LLMs is not only permitted in this course, but encouraged. \n- Use this course as an opportunity to learn where LLMs are most useful, and where they fall short.\n\nPotential uses of LLMs in Stat 131A:\n\n- Generating practice quiz questions\n- Explaining course concepts\n- Helping you code\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, **you can only use the course-approved LLM [PingPong](https://pingpong.hks.harvard.edu/login) for help on labs, homework, and the final project.**.\n\n- Furthermore, if you use PingPong to help you, **you must submit a PDF of the relevant PingPong conversation along with your assignment.**\n- You are responsible for understanding every line of code that you submit in 131A. Exams may ask you to explain specific lines of code used in lab and HW solutions. So, don't use LLMs to write code without taking time to understanding the code.\n- Of course, LLMs cannot be used on exams. \n\nIt is often easy to spot default LLM text output. \n\n- If you copy and paste answers directly from PingPong, be warned that your grader may interpret your answer as lacking in effort and **you may lose points on the assignment.**\n- Take the time to understand and paraphrase the information LLMs provide you.\n\n<!-- Many coding problems from past iterations of the course can now be fully solved by freely-available LLMs. -->\n<!-- With this advantange in mind, the difficulty and extent of coding required for this course may be increased substantially compared to previous years.  -->\n\n<!-- Researchers at the Harvard Computational Policy Lab have recently developed a ChatGPT alternative called PingPong.\nPingPong grants you free access to OpenAI's superior GPT-4 model (otherwise $20 / month). \nPingPong is fully aware of the MS&E 125 course materials, and can provide course-specific advice. \nIn addition, PingPong will walk you through ideas in a more streamlined fashion than the free or premium versions of ChatGPT, much like a helpful TA.  -->\n\n<!-- You can access the MS&E 125 version of PingPong here. (ADD LINK) -->\n\nIf you find an especially interesting use case of an LLM for any component of the course, please share it with the course staff! \nWe are excited to hear what you find. \n\n## Course communication üó£Ô∏è\n\nWe use the [Ed platform](https://edstem.org/us/courses/63606/discussion/) to manage course questions and discussion, and to make announcements.\n\nIn general, **do not email the course staff.**\n\n-   Exception: You are welcome to email individual members of the course staff if you have a private concern that you do not want shared with the entire course staff.\n\nPlease post publicly when possible.\n\n- **Public posts benefit many more students than private posts.**\n- We may ask you to change your private post to a public post if the answer could be of use to other students.\n- You are always allowed to remain anonymous!\n\nIf you include code in your Ed post, please use the `code editing fonts`:\n\n**Standard font is hard to read:**\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ Attaching packages

recommended interface. -->\n<!-- We extensively use the suite of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages. -->\n<!-- While you are free to use a programming language of your choice, the course staff can only guarantee assistance with code written in `R`. -->\n\n- As in Data 8 and Stat 20, labs and assignments will be distributed via [DataHub](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu).\n\n**You do not need to know anything about `R` to take this course.**\n\n- We will provide resources for you to learn everything you need to know.\n\n**The concepts taught in this course are language-agnostic.**\n\n- In other words, everything you learn in this class can be readily implemented using a combination of other tools (e.g., `Python`, `SQL`, etc.).\n- Note that LLMs are an excellent aid for translating your knowledge across different programming language and software. \n\n## Weekly topics ü•ó\n\nThe following is a **rough and optimistic** guideline for the material we will cover in the semester.\n\n- The actual topics may vary as the semester goes along.\n- It is likely that we will proceed more slowly than this schedule indicates.\n- Relevant sections of the [textbook](https://epurdom.github.io/Stat131A/book/index.html) are linked for each week, though you are only responsible for the material we cover in lecture, lab, or HW assignments.\n\nWeek 1.

catch-up and review.\nIf time permits, intro to causal inference.\n\n## Academic Honesty Policy üëç\n\nHomework and projects must be completed independently, with the following exceptions:\n\n- You may discuss specific issues/questions you have about the homework at a high level, but you must not sit down and do the assignment jointly.\n- Giving advice about code or coding tips is also not cheating, but you can not directly share code with other classmates.\n\nFor exams, cheating includes, but is not limited to, using electronic materials in an exam beyond that allowed, copying off another person's exam or quiz, allowing someone to copy off of your exam or quiz, and having someone take an exam or quiz for you.\n\nRequesting, obtaining, and/or using solutions from previous years or from the internet or other sources, if such happen to be available, is considered cheating.\n\nIn fairness to students who put in an honest effort, cheaters will be harshly treated.\n\n- **Any evidence of cheating will result in a score of zero (0) on the entire assignment or examination, and perhaps a failing grade in the class.**\n- We will always report incidences of cheating to the Office of Student Conduct, which may administer additional punishment.\n\n## Accommodations üíô\n\nUC Berkeley is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body including students with disabilities. \n\n- If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with Josh, whether after class, in office hours, via Ed, or via email.\n\n**If you already have a Letter of Accommodation, please open a private [Ed post](https://edstem.org/us/courses/63606/discussion/) ASAP and attach your LoA.** \n\n- We can accommodate you more easily if you provide this information early in the semester.\n- We cannot guarantee that last-minute requests for accommodation will be provided.\n\nIf you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you can work with the Disabled Students' Program (DSP) to determine any accommodations you may need to have equal access in this course. \n\n- The Disabled Students' Program (DSP) is the campus office responsible for authorizing disability-related academic accommodations, in cooperation with the students themselves and their instructors. \n- You can find more information about the DSP application process [here](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/new-students/application-process). \n- Josh is available if you have any questions or concerns about your accommodations.\n- In the event of a disagreement, the proper procedure is for you to work with your DSP Specialist and your DSP Specialist to work with Josh toward a resolution.\n\n## Accessible DS education for all ‚≠ê\n\nIn support of our commitment to making Data Science education inviting, engaging, and respectful for people of diverse identities, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, I want to relay the following three items from the Data Science Undergraduate Studies (DSUS): \n\n### Device Lending options\n\nStudents can access device lending options through the [Student Technology Equity Program (STEP) program](https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/devicelending).\n\n### Data Science Student Climate\n\nData Science Undergraduate Studies faculty and staff are committed to creating a community where every person feels respected, included, and supported. \nWe recognize that incidents may happen, sometimes unintentionally, that run counter to this goal. \nThere are many things we can do to try to improve the climate for students, but we need to understand where the challenges lie. \nIf you experience a remark, or disrespectful treatment, or if you feel you are being ignored, excluded or marginalized in a course or program-related activity, please speak up. \nConsider talking to your instructor, but you are also welcome to contact Executive Director Christina Teller at cpteller\\@berkeley.edu or report an incident anonymously through [this online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBwaUe7VMQz6VzkYFvf4KYwNSTve9iJlBSQyAmsXoSE0LnWw/viewform).\n\n### Community Standards\n\nEd is a formal, academic space. Posts in this forum must relate to the course and be in alignment with Berkeley‚Äôs Principles of Community and the Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct. We expect all posts to demonstrate appropriate respect, consideration, and compassion for others. Please be friendly and thoughtful; our community draws from a wide spectrum of valuable experiences. Posts that violate these standards will be removed. ","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<!-- \\[Syllabus subject to change until August 28th, 2024\\]. -->\n\n**Students in Stat 131A are expected to have read the syllabus in its entirety by the second week of the course.**\n\n## Course Details ü•ó\n\n### Description üîé\n\nStat 131A is a upper-division course that follows Data 8 or STAT 20.\nThe course will teach a broad range of statistical methods that are used to solve data problems, including group comparisons, standard parametric statistical models, multivariate data visualization, multiple linear regression and classification, classification and regression trees, and random forests.\nStudents will be introduced to the widely used `R` statistical language and they will obtain hands-on experience in implementing a range of statistical methods on numerous real world datasets.\n\nIn short, **Stat 131A will provide you with a Swiss army knife of foundational statistical methods to use for data science projects!**\n\n### Lectures üßë‚Äçüè´\n\nMWF 2-3pm \\@ [Morgan 101](https://dac.berkeley.edu/morgan-hall)\n\nLecture attendance is mandatory. See below for more details.\n\n### Labs üß™\n\nLab 101: Tuesday and Thursday, 11am-12pm \\@ [Evans 330](https://www.berkeley.edu/map/evans-hall/)\n\nLab 102: Tuesday and Thursday, 4-5pm \\@ Hearst Mining Bldg 310 (Hearst is next to [Evans Hall](https://www.berkeley.edu/map/evans-hall/))\n\nYou should only be signed up for one lab group.\n\nLab attendance is optional, but highly encouraged.\n\n### Office hours (OH) üóìÔ∏è\n\n<!-- OH times and locations are tentative.  -->\n\n<!-- - Note: There are no office hours in the first week of the course! -->\n\nJosh's Office Hours:\n\n- MWF 1:45pm + 3pm in lobby outside Morgan 101 (before and after lecture)\n- T+Th 7-8:30pm @ Evans 334\n\nVan's Office Hours:\n\n- ~~Wednesdays 10am-12pm @ Evans 434~~\n- Wednesdays 4-5pm (group tutoring), TBD\n- Wednesdays 5-6pm (office hours), TBD\n- Fridays 9am-11am on Zoom\n- For security reasons, Zoom links for OH are posted on [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1537932).\n\n20-minute coffee chats with Josh on the phone (experimental!):\n\n- One slot every weekday at 11am.\n- Designed for career and life advising, not logistical concerns or help with coursework.\n- Please limit to no more than one chat per month. \n- Book [at this link](https://calendly.com/jdgg-berkeley/20-minute-phone-call-with-josh?)\n\n<!-- - OH times will be posted shortly after the semester begins. -->\n<!-- - Please note that there are no regular OH during the first week of class. -->\nWe may add or reschedule OH if needed. \n\n- Please [create a private Ed post](https://edstem.org/us/courses/63606/discussion/) if you have conflicts with all of the scheduled OH. \n\n**Coming to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help.** In fact, the students who come to OH are often the most successful in the course.\n\n- OH is a great opportunity to discuss not only topics directly related to the course, but also anything else that's on your mind.\n- We also welcome questions about career trajectories and research opportunities at UC Berkeley and beyond.\n- Keep in mind that you **do not** need to come to office hours with an agenda. Listening in is welcomed and encouraged!\n- Finally, attending and participating in office hours is a great way to set yourself up for a terrific letter of recommendation. This is true for most courses!\n- If you don't already, I highly recommend that you attend the instructors' office hours in other classes from time to time.\n\n## Study groups üë•\n\nWe encourage you to work together in groups to solidify your understanding of the course material. \n\nIf you would like assistance forming a study group, please complete [the study group form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2XYenKGH8jtXAOUxSl8oXpQxiLwwDGw0edC9Qw56iwDPDjA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by Monday, September 2nd at 11:59pm PT. \n\nOur goal is to form the study groups ASAP, \nso students can begin discussing the first homework assignment.\n\n## Concurrent enrollment and auditing üëÇ\n\nConcurrent enrollment students wishing to register for the class should fill out this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbYciXBFrZvO1WbtsIOTCOiWmV2EvC3RqN0dW9_3NHzE2QWQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to give me information about their previous coursework so we can assess whether they have satisfied the pre-requisites.\n\n**UPDATE**: Stat 131A will not be enrolling concurrent enrollment students in Fall 2024. But, concurrent enrollment students are welcome to audit the course.\n\nStudents who wish to audit the course can also fill out the top portion of this form to get their email added to [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1537932) as a guest. \nOnly name and email is needed for auditors.\n\n## Course platforms üñ•Ô∏è\n\n[bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1537932) will only be used for secure course material, like exam solutions, grades, and office hour Zoom links.\n\nAll other course materials will be posted on [the public course homepage](https://stat131a.berkeley.edu/fall-2024).\n\nAssignments should be submitted via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/833089).\n\nAll course communication will take place via [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/63606/discussion/).\n\nThe only acceptable large-language model (LLM) for use in Stat 131a is [PingPong](https://pingpong.hks.harvard.edu/login). \n\n- **Unless otherwise indicated, all other LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) are prohibited and considered cheating in this course.**\n- Enrolled students will receive an invitation to PingPong via email shortly after the semester begins. \n\n## Grades üíØ\n\nGrades are calculated as follows:\n\n-   Lecture attendance and participation: 10%\n-   Labs: 10%\n-   Homework: 20%\n-   Final project: 15%\n-   Midterm 1 (during class): 10%\n-   Midterm 2 (during class): 15%\n-   Final: 20%\n\nGrades will not be curved.\n\n- In other words, there is no limit to the proportion of students with an A, B, etc. You are incentivized to help each other learn and succeed.\n- You are guaranteed an A if you score 93% or higher, an A- if 90% or higher, a B+ if 87% or higher, a B if 83% or higher, and so on.\n- A+ grades are awarded rarely, and only for truly exceptional performance.\n- Grade cutoffs may be adjusted downward at the end of the semester, but this is not guaranteed.\n\nSee attendance policy below for an opportunity to earn up to two percentage points of extra credit. \n\n## Lecture technology policy ‚ùå üë©‚Äçüíª $~$ ‚úÖüì±\n\nMost lectures will consist of an interactive problem-solving session, followed by a hands-on demo or coding session.\n\n- **Laptops and tablets with attached keyboards are not allowed during the problem-solving session**, though you are permitted to use a tablet to take handwritten notes. \n\n- If you need to use technology for accessibility reasons, the previous bullet does not apply to you. \n\n- Laptop use is permitted (and encouraged!) during the hands-on demo and coding sessions. \n\n- Phones are allowed during lecture. It is preferable to use a phone to submit conceptual questions and neighbor discussion answers during lecture.\n\n- [This article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html) explains why we have the laptop policy. Long story short, laptop use can negatively impact the learning of nearby students (i.e., this policy does not punish you; the policy prevents you from punishing others).\n\n- The course staff reserves the right to reduce your lecture attendance grade for violating the technology policy.\n\n## Lecture recordings üé•\n\nLectures will be recorded automatically.\n\n- The course staff cannot guarantee audio or video quality.\n- Lecture recordings are posted on [bcourses](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1537932).\n\nLabs and office hours are not recorded. \n\nThe homework assignments may occasionally ask you to watch additional recordings to supplement the lecture material (e.g., if we run out of time covering an essential topic).\n\n## Attendance and participation ‚úã\n\nIn-person lecture attendance is mandatory. \n\n- It is **critically** important to practice learning in a live setting.  \n- Difficulty with paying attention in live meetings is a common hurdle for new grads.\n\nLecture attendance is a substantial component of your grade. \n\n- Lecture cannot be attended remotely. \n- You are allowed three unexcused lecture absences. Each additional absence will impact your lecture attendance grade. \n\n**If you cannot attend a lecture due to an extenuating circumstance, please [complete the lecture attendance excusal form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQLdZRc0fCGDp-4zwtwvcbbh5F2olKB7dx_qVrNKmsY43cxg/viewform?usp=sf_link) before the lecture starts.**\n\n- This form can be completed months, weeks, or days in advance of lecture.\n\nAcceptable extenuating circumstances include: \n\n- Illness. **DO NOT come to class if you are sick!** Even a sniffle! \n- Personal emergencies. \n- Important life events (e.g., weddings)\n- Pre-planned collegiate athletic events in which you are a participant.\n- This list is not exhaustive. If you think an absence should be excused, [complete this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQLdZRc0fCGDp-4zwtwvcbbh5F2olKB7dx_qVrNKmsY43cxg/viewform?usp=sf_link) and explain your reasoning. We cannot guarantee that your absence will be excused, but we will be reasonable. \n\n### Concept checks ‚úÖ\n\nWe will use in-class concept checks and neighbor discussions to track attendance. \n\n- Concept checks are not graded.\n- Concept checks are answered via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnthLeOwlfNrkCJ69LWgWnmaA-qTNcbtxrHgMmWD4LCZVNug/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n<!-- - However, when deciding borderline final grades, we may consider demonstrated effort on concept checks. -->\n- Submitting a concept check outside of standard lecture time is considered cheating and an honor code violation. We will use your seat number and submission time to validate that your responses were entered during lecture time. We reserve the right to photograph the lecture hall to verify attendance. \n\n### Neighbor discussions üó£Ô∏è\n\nIn addition to concept checks, there may be one or more neighbor discussions during each lecture.\n\n- Neighbor discussion answers are submitted via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8XcctXgOv9kyJEdEL0JZtUMnhc5KWVEh1ifDL4qO6xB93Vg/viewform?usp=sf_link).\n- Neighbor discussion answers are not graded.\n\nTo encourage discussion among all classmates, **we will award up to two percentage points of extra credit for having a variety of neighbors.**\n\n- The students with the highest number of unique neighbors will receive the full two percentage points of extra credit.\n- Everyone else will receive, at the minimum, a fraction of extra credit proportional to their number of unique neighbors.\n- For example, if you sit next to the same person all semester, you can receive full participation credit for neighbor discussions, but you will very little extra credit.\n- The extra credit policy will only take effect if at least one student has spoken to at least 20 unique neighbors over the course of the semester.\n- As above, submitting a neighbor discussion answer outside of standard lecture time is considered cheating and an honor code violation.\n\n## Homework üìù\n\nThere are 6 homework assignments planned, though the exact number may change.\n\n- Homework will be a combination of computational exercises and data analysis using the computer, as well as conceptual questions.\n- Homework assignments are weighted equally. \n\nHW is generally due every other week.\n\n- Homework assignments will be posted to the course website at least one week before the HW deadline.\n- All homework assignments will be submitted via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/833089) and are due by 11:59 pm of the due date.\n\nWe will not drop your lowest-scoring homework assignment.\n\n- Instead, we will raise your lowest homework score to 80\\% of its maximum score, regardless of what you actually scored.\n- We will not change the grade of your lowest-scoring homework assignment if its score is above 80\\%.\n\n**Poorly organized assignments will be docked points at the discretion of the grader.**\n\n- It is critical to have empathy for the person who will be reviewing your work, whether a member of the course staff, another student providing feedback, or your future manager. \n\n## Late HW ‚è∞\n\n**You are allotted five slip days for labs and homework assignments.** \n\n- Each slip day adds 24 hours to the deadline. \n- Slip days cannot be used on the final project or exams.\n- Slip days are intended to account for unexpected delays, like minor illness or homework overload. \n- There is no extra credit awarded for unused slip days. \n- You cannot use partial slip days. \n\n**You are allowed to use, at most, two slip days per assignment.**\n\n- In other words, assignments will not be accepted more than 48 hours after the original due date. \n- This policy ensures that we can grade all assignments in a timely fashion. \n\nIf you plan to use slip days, **do not contact the course staff.**\n\n- We will automatically account for slip days when calculating grades.\n\nExtensions will only be granted if required by a Letter of Accommodation (LoA), or in extraordinary circumstances (e.g., medical emergencies). \n\n## Labs üß™\n\nDuring lab sessions, a GSI will review conceptual material and help you work through lab coding assignments.\n\n- Lab sections meet twice a week.\n- There are no lab sections the first week of classes.\n\nWe plan to have 12 lab assignments.\n\n- Each assignment will teach you how to perform the analyses shown in class using `R`.\n- Labs are intended to be finished or mostly finished during section.\n- HW assignments may build on the exercises covered in lab.\n\nLab assignments are generally due on Mondays at 11:59 pm and should be submitted via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/833089).\n\n- Labs are graded on completion, not correctness.\n\nWhile there is no Week 1 lab, there is a self-paced [Lab 0](assets/Lab00.html) for you to work through independently. This lab is not graded.\n\n- **Before the first lab section on Tuesday of Week 2, work through [Lab 0](assets/Lab00.html).**\n\n- You do not have to turn in this lab, but we will assume that you have worked through this lab and understand the code.\n- If you have questions about this lab, please come to office hours or post on Ed.\n\n<!-- ### Communicating with Instructional Staff -->\n\n<!-- The best way to ask a question to the instructor or GSI is to send a private message through Ed Discussion. -->\n<!-- This way it does not get lost in our inboxes and we can both see it and keep track of the responses to it. -->\n<!-- Ed Discussion will be checked by one of us at least once a day during the weekday, and almost *never* in the evening or the weekend. -->\n<!-- You can mark these messages with \"Administrative\" to make sure we see them. -->\n\n<!-- If you absolutely must email, in order for your email to make it into our inbox, the subject of your email must contain the text ‚ÄúSTAT 131A‚Äù. -->\n<!-- None of the instructors explain course material over email and will not respond to emails with such requests. -->\n<!-- Please come to office hours or discussion sections for questions about the material, or post questions to Ed Discussion. -->\n\n## Final project üìä\n\nThe final project will be due on the last day of reading week, **Friday December 13**.\n\nMore details on the final project will be provided later in the semester.\n\n## Exams ‚åõ\n\nThe first midterm is scheduled for **Wednesday October 9** and will take place during lecture in Morgan 101. \n\nThe second midterm is scheduled for **Wednesday November 13** and will take place during lecture in Morgan 101.\n\nThe final exam will take place **Thursday December 19, 3-6pm** (scheduled by the registrar). Location TBD.\n\n- All exams are cumulative, with emphasis on more recent material.\n\n- To acknowledge maturation over the course of the semester, exams are increasingly weighted in your course grade.\n\n- If you do not perform well on the first midterm, you can still do very well in 131a!\n\n- **Update:** We will raise your midterm 1 and midterm 2 scores to up to 80% of the maximum score, based on your performance on the relevant sections of the final.\n\n**If you cannot attend an exam due to an extenuating circumstance, please contact the course staff ASAP to determine whether your circumstance qualifies for a make-up exam.**\n\n<!-- # Using R and resources for R -->\n\n<!-- We will be using R to analyze data in this class. -->\n<!-- See [R resources](../../RSupport/RResources.html) for more information. -->\n<!-- You will be going through an introductory lab ([Lab 0](/RSupport/Lab00.html)) to help you refresh your skills. -->\n<!-- See our page on [R resources](../../RSupport/RResources.html) for useful tutorials and online help. -->\n\n<!-- We expect that students have already been exposed to R or python in either Stat 20 or Data 8, respectively. -->\n<!-- For those who come from Data 8, the first labs will help you transfer that knowledge over to R. -->\n<!-- Both languages are excellent platforms for analyzing data, are widely used in data science, and have their individual strengths. -->\n<!-- R has been developed within the statistics community specifically for data analysis, while python is a general-purpose programming language which also has large data analysis capabilities. -->\n\n<!-- The lectures will be focused on the statistical concepts. -->\n<!-- Learning how to do these tasks in R will be the focus of the labs. -->\n<!-- Do not be surprised or worried about not following the details of R code during lectures -- that is not the point (furthermore, there will sometimes be code that is really specific to the instructional purposes of the lecture, e.g. to make a specific plot, and is beyond the scope of what you would be expected to understand how to do yourself). -->\n\n<!-- In addition to what you learn in lab, the class website provides for every book chapter, complementary html/.Rmd with the code used in the lecture that will contain brief explanations, available (here)\\[https://epurdom.github.io/Stat131A/RSupport/index.html\\]. -->\n\n<!-- Furthermore, we expect that you've already been introduced to the basics, so that we will not need to walk you through every detail. -->\n<!-- The first step if you are confused about code is to look at the documentation of the function in R; the second step is to do a quick google search; and of course, ask us questions if you can't figure it out after doing that. -->\n\n## Textbooks and resources üìñ\n\nEverything you need to know for Stat 131a will be covered in lectures, labs, and assignments.\n\n- It is possible to do very well in Stat 131a without ever referring to an outside textbook or resource.\n\nHowever, most of the course material is covered by the online textbook developed specifically for 131A.\n\n- You can find the textbook [here](https://epurdom.github.io/Stat131A/book/).\n\nThe [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) is an *excellent* resource.\n\n- StatQuest provides videos on many of the topics we will cover in class. The instructor is very entertaining!\n\nIf you would like some additional optional reading, you can try the following books.\n\n-   [Theory Meets Data](http://stat88.org/textbook/content/intro.html) by Ani Adhikari. This is the online book for STAT 88 that covers introductory probability at the level of Stat 20.\n- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This is a free online book that covers the `tidyverse` set of `R` packages.\n-   *The Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis* by Ramsey and Schafer\n-   *Introductory Statistics with R* by Peter Dalgaard\n\nNone of these books covers all of the topics we will cover in 131A, nor do they necessarily have the same perspective and focus as this class.\n<!-- -- they do not have extensive use of bootstrapping and resampling methods. -->\nBut for those students wanting some additional structure or R assistance, these books may be helpful and should be at the right level for this class.\n\nStat 20 and Data 8 are similar courses, but each covers some subjects that the other does not.\nWhile we will cover these topics in class, you may find the following useful background if you are seeing them for the first time (more to follow):\n\n-   [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science](https://www.inferentialthinking.com), by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero -- chapters 11-13.\n\nThis is the online book used by Data 8.\nThese chapters introduce hypothesis testing using only resampling ideas, ideas which are not necessarily covered in Stat 20.\n<!-- Their examples integrate python code, which may not be familiar, but what the code is doing will probably make sense and not make it too difficult to follow. -->\n\n## Policy on Large Language Models (LLMs) üí¨\n\nLLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) are becoming increasingly essential in the workplace. \n\n- To that end, the use of LLMs is not only permitted in this course, but encouraged. \n- Use this course as an opportunity to learn where LLMs are most useful, and where they fall short.\n\nPotential uses of LLMs in Stat 131A:\n\n- Generating practice quiz questions\n- Explaining course concepts\n- Helping you code\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, **you can only use the course-approved LLM [PingPong](https://pingpong.hks.harvard.edu/login) for help on labs, homework, and the final project.**.\n\n- Furthermore, if you use PingPong to help you, **you must submit a PDF of the relevant PingPong conversation along with your assignment.**\n- You are responsible for understanding every line of code that you submit in 131A. Exams may ask you to explain specific lines of code used in lab and HW solutions. So, don't use LLMs to write code without taking time to understanding the code.\n- Of course, LLMs cannot be used on exams. \n\nIt is often easy to spot default LLM text output. \n\n- If you copy and paste answers directly from PingPong, be warned that your grader may interpret your answer as lacking in effort and **you may lose points on the assignment.**\n- Take the time to understand and paraphrase the information LLMs provide you.\n\n<!-- Many coding problems from past iterations of the course can now be fully solved by freely-available LLMs. -->\n<!-- With this advantange in mind, the difficulty and extent of coding required for this course may be increased substantially compared to previous years.  -->\n\n<!-- Researchers at the Harvard Computational Policy Lab have recently developed a ChatGPT alternative called PingPong.\nPingPong grants you free access to OpenAI's superior GPT-4 model (otherwise $20 / month). \nPingPong is fully aware of the MS&E 125 course materials, and can provide course-specific advice. \nIn addition, PingPong will walk you through ideas in a more streamlined fashion than the free or premium versions of ChatGPT, much like a helpful TA.  -->\n\n<!-- You can access the MS&E 125 version of PingPong here. (ADD LINK) -->\n\nIf you find an especially interesting use case of an LLM for any component of the course, please share it with the course staff! \nWe are excited to hear what you find. \n\n## Course communication üó£Ô∏è\n\nWe use the [Ed platform](https://edstem.org/us/courses/63606/discussion/) to manage course questions and discussion, and to make announcements.\n\nIn general, **do not email the course staff.**\n\n-   Exception: You are welcome to email individual members of the course staff if you have a private concern that you do not want shared with the entire course staff.\n\nPlease post publicly when possible.\n\n- **Public posts benefit many more students than private posts.**\n- We may ask you to change your private post to a public post if the answer could be of use to other students.\n- You are always allowed to remain anonymous!\n\nIf you include code in your Ed post, please use the `code editing fonts`:\n\n**Standard font is hard to read:**\n\n‚îÄ‚îÄ Attaching packages

recommended interface. -->\n<!-- We extensively use the suite of [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages. -->\n<!-- While you are free to use a programming language of your choice, the course staff can only guarantee assistance with code written in `R`. -->\n\n- As in Data 8 and Stat 20, labs and assignments will be distributed via [DataHub](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu).\n\n**You do not need to know anything about `R` to take this course.**\n\n- We will provide resources for you to learn everything you need to know.\n\n**The concepts taught in this course are language-agnostic.**\n\n- In other words, everything you learn in this class can be readily implemented using a combination of other tools (e.g., `Python`, `SQL`, etc.).\n- Note that LLMs are an excellent aid for translating your knowledge across different programming language and software. \n\n## Weekly topics ü•ó\n\nThe following is a **rough and optimistic** guideline for the material we will cover in the semester.\n\n- The actual topics may vary as the semester goes along.\n- It is likely that we will proceed more slowly than this schedule indicates.\n- Relevant sections of the [textbook](https://epurdom.github.io/Stat131A/book/index.html) are linked for each week, though you are only responsible for the material we cover in lecture, lab, or HW assignments.\n\nWeek 1. \nPrinciples of visualization.\n\nWeek 2. \nBoxplots and histograms. \nDiscrete and continuous distributions.\n[2.1](https://epurdom.github.io/Stat131A/book/data-distributions.html),

catch-up and review.\nIf time permits, intro to causal inference.\n\n## Academic Honesty Policy üëç\n\nHomework and projects must be completed independently, with the following exceptions:\n\n- You may discuss specific issues/questions you have about the homework at a high level, but you must not sit down and do the assignment jointly.\n- Giving advice about code or coding tips is also not cheating, but you can not directly share code with other classmates.\n\nFor exams, cheating includes, but is not limited to, using electronic materials in an exam beyond that allowed, copying off another person's exam or quiz, allowing someone to copy off of your exam or quiz, and having someone take an exam or quiz for you.\n\nRequesting, obtaining, and/or using solutions from previous years or from the internet or other sources, if such happen to be available, is considered cheating.\n\nIn fairness to students who put in an honest effort, cheaters will be harshly treated.\n\n- **Any evidence of cheating will result in a score of zero (0) on the entire assignment or examination, and perhaps a failing grade in the class.**\n- We will always report incidences of cheating to the Office of Student Conduct, which may administer additional punishment.\n\n## Accommodations üíô\n\nUC Berkeley is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body including students with disabilities. \n\n- If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with Josh, whether after class, in office hours, via Ed, or via email.\n\n**If you already have a Letter of Accommodation, please open a private [Ed post](https://edstem.org/us/courses/63606/discussion/) ASAP and attach your LoA.** \n\n- We can accommodate you more easily if you provide this information early in the semester.\n- We cannot guarantee that last-minute requests for accommodation will be provided.\n\nIf you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you can work with the Disabled Students' Program (DSP) to determine any accommodations you may need to have equal access in this course. \n\n- The Disabled Students' Program (DSP) is the campus office responsible for authorizing disability-related academic accommodations, in cooperation with the students themselves and their instructors. \n- You can find more information about the DSP application process [here](https://dsp.berkeley.edu/students/new-students/application-process). \n- Josh is available if you have any questions or concerns about your accommodations.\n- In the event of a disagreement, the proper procedure is for you to work with your DSP Specialist and your DSP Specialist to work with Josh toward a resolution.\n\n## Accessible DS education for all ‚≠ê\n\nIn support of our commitment to making Data Science education inviting, engaging, and respectful for people of diverse identities, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, I want to relay the following three items from the Data Science Undergraduate Studies (DSUS): \n\n### Device Lending options\n\nStudents can access device lending options through the [Student Technology Equity Program (STEP) program](https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/devicelending).\n\n### Data Science Student Climate\n\nData Science Undergraduate Studies faculty and staff are committed to creating a community where every person feels respected, included, and supported. \nWe recognize that incidents may happen, sometimes unintentionally, that run counter to this goal. \nThere are many things we can do to try to improve the climate for students, but we need to understand where the challenges lie. \nIf you experience a remark, or disrespectful treatment, or if you feel you are being ignored, excluded or marginalized in a course or program-related activity, please speak up. \nConsider talking to your instructor, but you are also welcome to contact Executive Director Christina Teller at cpteller\\@berkeley.edu or report an incident anonymously through [this online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBwaUe7VMQz6VzkYFvf4KYwNSTve9iJlBSQyAmsXoSE0LnWw/viewform).\n\n### Community Standards\n\nEd is a formal, academic space. Posts in this forum must relate to the course and be in alignment with Berkeley‚Äôs Principles of Community and the Berkeley Campus Code of Student Conduct. We expect all posts to demonstrate appropriate respect, consideration, and compassion for others. Please be friendly and thoughtful; our community draws from a wide spectrum of valuable experiences. Posts that violate these standards will be removed.
