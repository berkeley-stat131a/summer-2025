However, I may curve *upwards* if the exams prove harder than I intended. I design exams fresh every semester, so it's hard to perfectly calibrate their difficulty.\n\n### Letter grades\n\nWe follow the standard university grading system. 97% = A+, 93% = A, 90% = A-, 87% = B+, etc\n\n### Laptop policy\n\nLaptops closed during lecture unless otherwise indicated.\n\n### Attendance\n\nMeasured through an attendance check in the middle of lecture. Don't sweat missing a class here and there, you'll get full credit if you attend 80% of classes.\n\n### Lecture recordings\n\nWill be posted after class\n\n### Office Hours\n\nSee Main page\n\n### Collaboration policy\n\nAll assignments are *individual assignments* unless otherwise indicated. However, you can ask other students for help with specific questions or to better understand something in general - you just can't do the assignment together.\n\n### Late Assignments\n\nAll assignments are worth 10 points. For every day late (up to 1 week) you lose 1 point off the top.\n\n### Exams\n\n- Midterm: July 17 (review day in class on July 16)\n- Final (cumulative): August 14 (review day in class on August 13)\n\n### Even more resources\n\nEverything you need to know for Stat 131a will be covered in lectures, labs, and assignments.\n\n- It is possible to do very well in Stat 131a without ever referring to an outside textbook or resource.\n\nHowever, most of the course material is covered by the online textbook developed specifically for 131A.\n\n- You can find the textbook [here](https://epurdom.github.io/Stat131A/book/).\n\nThe [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) is an *excellent* resource.\n\n- StatQuest provides videos on many of the topics we will cover in class. The instructor is very entertaining!\n\nIf you would like some additional optional reading, you can try the following books.\n\n-   [Theory Meets Data](http://stat88.org/textbook/content/intro.html) by Ani Adhikari. This is the online book for STAT 88 that covers introductory probability at the level of Stat 20.\n- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This is a free online book that covers the `tidyverse` set of `R` packages.\n-   *The Statistical Sleuth: A Course in Methods of Data Analysis* by Ramsey and Schafer\n-   *Introductory Statistics with R* by Peter Dalgaard\n\nNone of these books covers all of the topics we will cover in 131A, nor do they necessarily have the same perspective and focus as this class.\n<!-- -- they do not have extensive use of bootstrapping and resampling methods. -->\nBut for those students wanting some additional structure or R assistance, these books may be helpful and should be at the right level for this class.\n\nStat 20 and Data 8 are similar courses, but each covers some subjects that the other does not.\nWhile we will cover these topics in class, you may find the following useful background if you are seeing them for the first time (more to follow):\n\n-   [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science](https://www.inferentialthinking.com), by Ani Adhikari and John DeNero -- chapters 11-13.\n\nThis is the online book used by Data 8.\nThese chapters introduce hypothesis testing using only resampling ideas, ideas which are not necessarily covered in Stat 20.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# SYLLABUS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION\n\n### Grading:\n\n| Component | Fraction | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Attendance | 10% | Attend 80% of classes for full credit |\n| Labs/Homework | 20% | Two lowest grades dropped |\n| Midterm | 30% | |\n| Final | 40% | |\n\n### Curving\n\nThis class is not curved.
