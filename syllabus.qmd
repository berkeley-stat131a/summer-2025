# SYLLABUS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

### Grading:

| Component | Fraction | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attendance | 10% | Attend 80% of classes for full credit |
| Labs/Homework | 20% | Two lowest grades dropped |
| Midterm | 30% | |
| Final | 40% | |

### Curving

This class is not curved. However, I may curve *upwards* if the exams prove harder than I intended. I design exams fresh every semester, so it's hard to perfectly calibrate their difficulty.

### Letter grades

We follow the standard university grading system. 97% = A+, 93% = A, 90% = A-, 87% = B+, etc

### Laptop policy

Laptops closed during lecture unless otherwise indicated.

### Assignments and late policy

- You can submit assignments up to one week late, with a penalty of 10% per day late.
- I drop your two lowest assignments in grading

### Attendance

Measured through an attendance check in the middle of lecture. Don't sweat missing a class here and there, you'll get full credit if you attend 80% of classes.

### Lecture recordings

Will be posted after class, see main page.

### Office Hours

See Main page

### Collaboration policy

All assignments are *individual assignments* unless otherwise indicated. However, you can ask other students for help with specific questions or to better understand something in general - you just can't do the assignment together.

### Late Assignments

All assignments are worth 10 points. For every day late (up to 1 week) you lose 1 point off the top.

### Exams

- Midterm: July 17 (review day in class on July 16)
- Final (cumulative): August 14 (review day in class on August 13)

### Even more resources

Everything you need to know for Stat 131a will be covered in lectures, labs, and assignments. However, most of the course material is covered by the online textbook developed specifically for 131A.

- You can find the textbook [here](https://epurdom.github.io/Stat131A/book/) or on the homepage
