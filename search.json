However, I may curve upwards if the exams prove harder than I intended. I design exams fresh every semester, so it‚Äôs hard to perfectly calibrate their difficulty.\n\n\nLetter grades\nWe follow the standard university grading system. 97% = A+, 93% = A, 90% = A-, 87% = B+, etc\n\n\nLaptop policy\nLaptops closed during lecture unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nAssignments and late policy\n\nYou can submit assignments up to one week late, with a penalty of 10% per day late.\nI drop your two lowest assignments in grading\n\n\n\nAttendance\nMeasured through an attendance check in the middle of lecture. Don‚Äôt sweat missing a class here and there, you‚Äôll get full credit if you attend 80% of classes.\n\n\nLecture recordings\nWill be posted after class, see main page.\n\n\nOffice Hours\nSee Main page\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nAll assignments are individual assignments unless otherwise indicated. However, you can ask other students for help with specific questions or to better understand something in general - you just can‚Äôt do the assignment together.\n\n\nLate Assignments\nAll assignments are worth 10 points. For every day late (up to 1 week) you lose 1 point off the top.\n\n\nExams\n\nMidterm: July 17 (review day in class on July 16)\nFinal (cumulative): August 14 (review day in class on August 13)\n\n\n\nEven more resources\nEverything you need to know for Stat 131a will be covered in lectures, labs, and assignments. However, most of the course material is covered by the online textbook developed specifically for 131A.\n\nYou can find the textbook here or on the homepage\n\nOther resources that may be helpful:\n\nR beginner tutorials\nMarkdown Cheatsheet\nData Viz online book\nStatQuest YouTube Channel\n\nStatQuest provides videos on many of the topics we will cover in class. The instructor is very entertaining!\n\nR for Data Science, by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This is a free online book that covers the tidyverse set of R packages.\nTheory Meets Data by Ani Adhikari. This is the online book for STAT 88 that covers introductory probability at the level of Stat 20.",
