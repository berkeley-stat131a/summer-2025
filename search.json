If you would like to review a screencast for HW2, please open a private Ed post letting us know.\nPublic links to screencasts can be found here.\n\nFor this exercise, you will write detailed feedback on your assigned screencast.\n\nKeep in mind that this feedback will be anonymously provided to the student who recorded the screencast.\nPlease be constructive and supportive with any criticism, and do not hold back on providing praise where deserved!\n\nAs you write your feedback, you may want to consider the prompts below. However, do not feel limited to just these prompts, and do not feel compelled to address every single prompt.\n\nWhat did you enjoy most about the presentation?\nWhat insights did you find particularly interesting?\nDid the presenter follow the key three tips of describing the x-axis, describing the y-axis, and explaining a plot feature (e.g., a point or line) in context, before diving into the details?\nCould the presenter have done anything to help you understand the plot more easily? Were you confused at any point?\nDid you find the tone of the presentation engaging? Did it sound like the presenter had practiced their presentation, or that they spent time thoughtfully writing a script for the presentation?\nDid the presenter sufficiently describe the contents of the plot?\nDid you have enough background information to understand the plot? Could the presentation have benefited from any more background information?\nDid the presenter describe the key takeaways of the plot? In other words, did the presenter explain why the plot actually matters in a real life context, as opposed to just explain how to read the plot?\nDid the presenter provide any extraneous information or “over-describe” anything? In other words, could the presenter have shortened any parts of the presentation without harming its key takeaways?\nWould any parts of the presentation benefit from more description or detail? Did anything feel rushed? \nDo you have any “nits” about the presentation (i.e., very small changes that could improve the presentation, like a typo or mispronunciation)? If you choose to answer this prompt, it should not take up more than 10% of the text of your entire feedback. Focus your energy on the “big picture” prompts.\n\nYour feedback will be graded based on demonstrated effort and thoughtfulness.\n\nYou should aim to write at least two paragraphs of feedback.\nYour feedback can alternatively be written as an organized, bulleted list equivalent in word count to at least two paragraphs.\n\nWhy complete this problem? Writing detailed feedback on another student’s plot presentation will help you become a better presenter. One of the hardest data science skills to develop is “presentation empathy”, or a sense of how someone who has never seen your work before will interpret your presentations After staring at your own work for hours, it can be hard to see your work with “fresh eyes”. If you are at all surprised by the feedback you receive on your own screencast (or receive feedback with which you disagree!), take that moment as an excellent opportunity to understand how other people can interpret your work differently than you interpret your own work. Remember, it is not the audience’s responsibility to decipher your presentation for its intended interpretation. You need to carefully prepare your presentation so that the intended interpretation is crystal clear!"

    "text": "📤 Setting up spam classification with Naive Bayes (15%) This question is now optional, and worth up to two points of extra credit.\nIn the coding portion of the homework, you will implement a Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or not spam. This problem will help kick start your implementation of Naive Bayes in R.\n\nTo prepare for this problem, you may find it helpful to watch this tutorial on Naive Bayes for spam classification.\nYou may also want to read the IRS race classification slides that we did not have time to cover in lecture.\n\n\nExpress the following as a probability statement: “The probability that an email containing the strings”free”, “money”, and “$” is spam.”\n\nMake sure to define any notation you use in your probability statement.\nFor example, you might define \\(\\Pr(\\text{free})\\) as the probability that an email contains the string “free”.\n\nUsing Bayes’ Rule, write an equation for your probability statement from part (a).\n\nHint: The right-hand side of the equation should have three distinct terms.\n\nExpand the numerator of the right-hand side of the equation from part (b) using the chain rule of probability.\n\nWe saw the chain rule of probability in lecture: \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A) \\cdot \\Pr(B | A)\\), \\(\\Pr(A \\cap B \\cap C) = \\Pr(A) \\cdot \\Pr(B | A) \\cdot \\Pr(C | A ,B)\\), and so on.\n\nSuppose we make the strong assumption that word occurrences are conditionally independent of the email being spam or not spam.\n\nUnder this assumption, how can we simplify the numerator of the probability statement from part (c)?\n\nDescribe a process for estimating \\(\\Pr(\\text{free} | \\text{spam})\\) using a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam.\n\nYour answer to part (d) should contain a term like \\(\\Pr(\\text{free} | \\text{spam})\\), where \\(\\text{free}\\) denotes the event that an email contains the string “free” and \\(\\text{spam}\\) denotes the event that an email is spam.\n\nFinally, suppose we use the estimation procedure you proposed in part (e) to estimate the terms in the numerator of the right-hand side of your probability statement from part (d).\n\nIf we want to classify an email as more likely to be spam or not spam, why can we ignore the denominator in the right-hand side of your probability statement from part (d)?\nHint: You may find it helpful rewrite the equation in part (d) for the case where we want to estimate the conditional probability that the email is not spam.\n\n\nOnce you complete parts (a) through (f) above, you are ready to implement a Naive Bayes classifier in R!\nWhy complete this problem? This problem is the first classifier you will implement in 131A. We will return to classifiers when we learn about logistic regression and decision trees. Later in the course, you will be able to compare the performance of your Naive Bayes classifier in HW2 to alternative classifiers trained on the same spam dataset."

You do not need to read the research paper in full to understand the plot, but you might find it helpful to reference.\nIn your screencast, you must explain the minimum necessary background required to understand the plot, along with the key takeaway(s) of the plot.\nYour name and face should not be in the screencast. In other words, the plot should take up the entire window of the screencast, with your voice playing in the background. Do not introduce yourself or use any identifying information.\nYou should use your mouse pointer to indicate particular points of interest on the plot. Alternatively, you can verbally direct the viewer to points of interest (e.g., “In the top right corner, you can see that…”).\nYou should use an engaging tone that sounds as though you are presenting to a live audience.\nYou are welcome to read off a script that you have written ahead of time, but try not to make it too obvious. In fact, it can be very helpful to write a script for a presentation ahead of time, even if you do not actually read the script when presenting.\nRemember the three key guiding questions you should address before digging into the details: (1) What’s on the X axis? (2) What’s on the Y axis? (3) What does a specific point/line/feature on your plot mean in context?\nThere are lots of free tools for recording screencasts. For example, QuickTime is a useful tool for recording screencasts on a Mac. Feel free to post on Ed if you cannot identify a way to record a screencast anonymously.\nIf you need more than 60-90 seconds to record for accessibility reasons, please let the teaching staff know via Ed.\n\nAs part of HW2, you will provide anonymous feedback on another student’s submission for this problem.\n\nYour screencast, along with the quality of feedback you provide to another student, will be graded by the teaching staff. At no point will other students grade your work.\n\n💾 Upload your screencast to your UC Berkeley Google Drive account, or another place that allows you to share a public link.\n\nYou will submit a public link to your screencast in two places. See submission details at the top of this page.\nBefore submitting, make sure your screencast is publicly accessible with the link. One easy way to do this: Open the link in an incognito window in Google Chrome.\nIf your video is private or unviewable when we try to access it, we will not be able to confirm that you submitted your video before the HW1 deadline. You may lose points and/or have to use slip day(s).\n\nWhy complete this problem? Communication is a critical, but often under-appreciated, component of the data science life cycle. This exercise helps develop your data storytelling ability, which is essential for getting anyone to actually care about your statistical analyses!"

However, keep in mind that LDL levels are not just a function of diet, but also genetics, exercise, and other factors.\n\nFor the problem below, please show all steps.\n\nYou are welcome to use a scientific calculator or R for arithmetic (e.g., no need to do long division by hand).\n\nSuppose UC Berkeley scientists develop a new LDL-reducing drug.\n\nThe scientists want to compare the average efficacy of the new drug to the average efficacy of a brand name statin called Lipitor.\nThe scientists randomly assign either the new drug or Lipitor to 80 year-old patients with similarly high LDL levels.\n\nAfter three months of the patients taking either the new drug or Lipitor, you obtain the following data on LDL levels for the patients in each group.\n\nNote that LDL is measured in milligrams of LDL per deciliter of blood (mg/dL), Blood glucose has the same units (see coding section!).\n\n  ldl_lipitor = c(208, 197, 184, 194, 201, 196, 181, 207, 176, 198, 188, 195, 184, 189, 205, 188, 190, 188, 192, 181, 176, 193, 181, 176)\n  \n  ldl_new_drug = c(181, 190, 193, 176, 205, 161, 193, 189, 171, 180, 185, 185, 206, 173, 197, 179, 199, 170, 195, 176, 183, 186, 180, 182, 185, 178, 178)\nFor this scenario, answer the following:\n\nEstimand\n\nWhat is a reasonable difference in means estimand?\n\nMake sure to define any terms used in your estimand, and be specific about the relevant population.\n\n\n\n\nNull hypothesis\n\nWhat is a reasonable null hypothesis that uses your estimand?\n\n\n\nEstimator\n\nWhat is a reasonable estimator for your estimand?\n\nAgain, make sure to define any variables used in your answer.\n\nWhat is your point estimate? Make sure to include units.\nWhat is the sampling distribution of your estimator under the null hypothesis?\n\nHint: Is the normal distribution appropriate given the number of observations?\n\n\n\n\nConfidence interval\n\nWhat is a 90% confidence interval for your estimand?\n\nDerive your answer using &lt;r,p,q,d&gt;&lt;distribution&gt; R functions (e.g., runif).\nConfirm your answer by using a built-in hypothesis testing function in R (e.g., prop.test). You may have to use Google or PingPong to find the right testing function!\nThe derived result and testing function result should be similar, but it is OK if they are slightly different due to subtle differences in underlying methodology.\nThe code notebook for this HW contains space to include your code for question 6.\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis test\n\nWhat is the two-sided p-value associated with your null hypothesis and point estimate?\n\nDerive your answer using &lt;r,p,q,d&gt;&lt;distribution&gt; R functions (e.g., runif).\nConfirm your answer by using a built-in hypothesis testing function in R (e.g., prop.test).\nAgain, the derived result and testing function result should be similar, but it is OK if they are slightly different.\n\nWhat range of point estimates would have rejected the null hypothesis at a significance level (i.e., \\(\\alpha\\)) of 0.1?\nIs the result of your hypothesis test consistent with your confidence interval? Why or why not?\n\nThe code notebook for this HW contains space to include your code for questions 7 through 9.\n\n\n\n\nPower\n\nProvide a reasonable estimate of the power of a hypothesis test with \\(\\alpha=0.1\\) and sample sizes equal to the sample sizes in the data above.\n\nBe sure to state any additional assumptions needed to calculate power.\nDerive your answer using &lt;r,p,q,d&gt;&lt;distribution&gt; R functions (e.g., runif).\nConfirm your answer using an online power calculator. Take a screenshot of the calculator’s output as confirmation, and submit this screenshot with your handwritten work. There are many power calculators available. Google is your friend here!\nThe derived power and power calculator output should be similar, but it is OK if they are slightly different.\nThe code notebook for this HW contains space to include your code for question 10.\n\n\n\nIn general, power should be calculated BEFORE a hypothesis test, not after. Calculating power after an experiment is considered “cheating.” At the end of the day, this problem is simply intended to give you some practice calculating power. See this blog post for more details. Post-hoc (i.e., after the fact) power calculations are bad practice, but very common!\n\n\nAlso, we typically calculate power for a range of possible effect sizes, sample sizes, and significance levels (\\(\\alpha\\)), and generate power curves that are functions of these inputs. With some massaging, you could optionally turn your code for question 10 into a function that takes effect size, sample size, and significance levels as inputs, and returns power. Then, you could use geom_function to draw a power curve. It’s less code than you might think! See the Lecture 12 code for boilerplate power curve code."
